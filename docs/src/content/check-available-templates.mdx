# Listing available templates

Notify allows you to inspect which templates are available. This could allow you
to build your own interfaces or tooling which operates on Notify.

For example, you could easily build a service which checks for which templates are
availble, inspects which variables they require, and then presents an operator
with a form to fill out which could submit and send messages using that
template.

Another example could be checking all sent messages for a template selected from
the full set of templates.


The following example shows how to send a single email.

<Examples path="listing-templates"/>

## Arguments

`template_id`

**Required**

The ID of the template. You can find this by signing into Notify and
going to the Templates page.

---


`email_address`

**Required**

The address of the recipient of the email.

---


`personalisation`

**Optional** depending on template

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name
or reference number, you need to provide their values in a map with key
and value pairs.

For example:

```json
{
    "first_name": "Lisa",
    "amount_owing": "$15.50"
}
```

---

`reference`

**Optional**

A unique identifier you create. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. If you do not have a reference, you must pass in an empty string or null.

## Response

If successful, the shape of the response you recieve will resemble the
following.


```json
{
  "content": {
    "body": "Hey there. Lisa\n\nPlease pay us $15.50 at your earliest convenience.\n", 
    "from_email": "your-service@digital.gov.au", 
    "subject": "Pay your bill soon."
  }, 
  "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-nnnnnnnnnnnn",
  "reference": "STRING", 
  "scheduled_for": null, 
  "template": {
    "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-tttttttttttt",
    "uri": "https://rest-api.notify.gov.au/services/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-ssssssssssss/templates/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-tttttttttttt",
    "version": 3
  }, 
  "uri": "https://rest-api.notify.gov.au/v2/notifications/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-nnnnnnnnnnnn"
}
```
